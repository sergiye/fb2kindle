I've been playing around with your mobieditor 1.1.  Great program. 
Simple, direct.  This is the way programs should be written.

I noticed two relatively minor issues.

1) Your program writes too many bytes as padding between the end of the 
EXTH header records and the remainder of the the first PDB record.  With 
the mobi file I was using to test (ie saving a file without any 
changes), It wrote 8 bytes of 0, when only 2 bytes were needed (and 
present in the original file).  It's as if your program was writing 2 
4-byte integers of 0, instead of 2 bytes of 0.  I've seen this behaviour 
when using vc.net's binarywriter ie binarywriter.write(0), which should 
be binarywriter.write((byte)0).

2) Your program needs to update the full name offset in the mobiheader 
when the size of the exth header is changed.  The full name offset is a 
pointer to a zero-terminated string (representing the book's title) 
located in the extra bytes of PDB record that follow after the EXTH 
header or after the mobi header if there is no exth header.

Generally, these issues don't make much of a difference as most readers 
ignore anything past the end of the exth header and use the exth header 
for the book title instead of the mobiheader.  However, these 
incosistencies can cause issues for programs like Calibre that make more 
extensive use of ebook metadata.
