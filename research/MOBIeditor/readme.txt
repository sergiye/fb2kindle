-------------- Release Notes --------------

Point to a .mobi file and this program extracts the meta data and presents it in a simple editable list. It seems to mostly work.

I use the ILMerge tool to link everything together after building. It is optional and you can get it from Microsoft:

-------------- Versions --------------

v1.1	Added ability to quickly open the next/previous MOBI file in the current directory.
v1.0	Original release. Add, edit, delete mobi meta data (specifically: EXTH header records).
